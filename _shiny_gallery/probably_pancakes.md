title: Probably Pancakes
excerpt: App for classifying recipes as pancakes/not pancakes
---

### Description:
An app that takes a user input recipe and classifies it as pancakes or not pancakes using a Random Forest algorithm trained on a data set of 3,200 recipes I collected from the web in 2018.

### Goal:
My household has a recipe written on a scrap of paper labeled "probably pancakes" (spoiler alert: it's definitely pancakes). I have a weakness for over-engineered solutions to silly problems, so I set out to create a highly polished app to identify pancake recipes.

### Outcome:
I submitted the app to the 2nd Annual Shiny competition hosted by RStudio. Though the app did not win, it was invited to be included in the RStudio Shiny gallery (forthcoming).

### Notable Features:
* Flexible and dynamic UI driven by Shiny modules. User can input any number of desired ingredients, while the code remains succinct and easily maintained on the back end.
* Custom CSS, demonstrating the level of polish possible for clinet-facing products.

### Technology Used:
* Shiny
* Shiny modules
* data.table
* HTML/CSS
