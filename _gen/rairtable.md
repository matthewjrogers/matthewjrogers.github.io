### Description
[Cribbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbage) is my favorite card game, and my family takes our games very seriously. Over the years I've had several questions that were challenging to answer by just playing the game, such as:
* How much of an advantage is the first crib?
* Which cards are best for pegging?
* How does selecting 4 cards from an initial hand of 6 affect the prevalence of any given card in final hands?

### Goal
Efficiently interact with large Airtable tables and allow Airtable to be integrated into existing Tidyverse data science workflows

### Outcome
An R package

### Notable Features
* Batch CRUD functionality
* Optional parallel JSON processing for JSON encoding large tables

### Technology Used
* R
* S3
