### Description:
[Cribbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbage) is my favorite card game, and my family takes our games very seriously. Over the years I've had several questions that were challenging to answer by just playing the game, such as:
* How much of an advantage is the first crib?
* Which cards are best for pegging?
* How does selecting 4 cards from an initial hand of 6 affect the prevalence of any given card in final hands?

### Goal:
Win more games of cribbage (with data)

### Outcome:
Based on the results of an [earlier simulation](https://github.com/matthewjrogers/julia_plays_cribbage) written in Julia, I gave a well received TED-style presentation while at RSG as part of a weekly lunch-and-learn.

### Notable Features
* Recursive function to check for runs

### Technology Used:
* Python
