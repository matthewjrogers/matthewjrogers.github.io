Machine learning has been a passion project of mine for several years. I have read widely on the subject and completed several DataCamp courses on supervised and unsupervised methods. Additionally I participated in a full-day workshop at the 2018 NewYorkR conference led by Max Kuhn.

To date, I have participated in three online machine learning competitions through DrivenData.org. I am currently ranked in the top 5% or better of two competitions, and in the top 8% of the other.
