I am an accomplished Shiny developer. In addition to the apps listed here, I have also:
* Developed an app for Pratt & Whitney's Aftermarket operations division that housed a statistical repair capacity model.
   * Built ETL functionality for the app that connected repair shops to a central database in real time
* Developed an app to house a scenario simulation model for a major international airport
   * App contained over 200 inputs, allowing the end users to plan for a vast range of scenarios
   * Used Shiny modules to maintain a clear, navigable code base despite the large number of inputs
