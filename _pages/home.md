title: My name is Matt Rogers

I'm a programmer, analyst, and problem solver with a passion for process improvement. I'm always eager for new challenges and the opportunity to acquire new skills. 

I live with my wife and two cats in South Royalton, VT and enjoy a wide range of hobbies in my free time, from woodworking to bookbinding.
