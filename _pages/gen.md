### I'm always learning something new
Whether it's developing a new skill or digging up data to answer a question (either serious or silly), I love new puzzles, challenges, and opportunities.

The projects listed here range from game simulations written in Python and Julia to a web scraper written in R to statistical analysis of fatal motorcycle accidents.
